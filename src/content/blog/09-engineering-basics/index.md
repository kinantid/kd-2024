As daunting as the task is, ask yourself: How can I do this?

Things to check when things don't work

- Problems - any import, type errors, something else? 
- Restart the TS server
- Uninstall and reinstall dependencies
- Restart the IDE
- Ask a code-specific GPT about the different approaches to debug this based on the context of your codebase structure, languages used, package manager
- Restart your computer
